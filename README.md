# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Objective : 
We are asked to preform the credit card risk analysis project.  This is a real-world challenge and we choose to apply machine learning to solve the challenge.
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we perform three technical analysis deliverables and a written report : The three technical analysis are : Resampling Models, the SMOTEENN Algorithm, and Ensemble Classifiers 

## Resampling Models : Credit Risk Resampling
Reviewing the dataset from LendingClud there is class imbalance between high risk and low risk credit card with the total of 68470 low_risk application vs 347 high_risk. With this class imbalanced dataset we have to use resampling models to remove imbalance between class. These are : Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Combination Sampling. Through the sampling models and validating the Naive Random Oversampling has the best balanced accuracy score of 0.677, the best recall score for identification high_risk application/credit users of 0.76, and the best geometric mean score of 0.67. Here are the summary table of Naive Random Oversampling the models :

 Even compare to the SMOTEENN Algorithm the Naive Radnom Oversampling still have better scores :

## Ensemble Classifiers : Credit Risk Ensemble 
Now we use the data training algorithm to find the best model have better prediction accuracy, trainin algorithm  we used are Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier. The Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier has the best balanced accuracy score of 0.93, the best recall score for identification high_risk application/credit users of 0.92, and the best geometric mean score of 0.93

## Model recommendation :
Base on six machine leanrning models we recommend Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier because it has the best balanced accuracy score of 0.93, the best recall score for identification high_risk of 0.92, and the best geometric mean score of 0.93
